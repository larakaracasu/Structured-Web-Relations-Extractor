Given a sentence, extract all subject and object pairs for the Top_Member_Employees relation. Only extract pairs where the object, a person, was a top member employee of the subject, an organization. The object should be a high-ranking employee of the subject. The subject should not be a school or university. Both subject and object must be a proper noun capitalized in the given sentence.

If you were able to extract at least a relation:
